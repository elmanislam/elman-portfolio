      <h2> <mark>ABOUT</mark> ME</h2>
      <p> Welcome to my website. I'm a 3rd Year Co-op student in Software Engineering with a major in Mathematics. 
          I am currently attending the University of Guelph from 2020 - 2025. As an honour student, I have achieved a $3500 entrance scholarship 
          and have maintained an excellent standing in my academics. I have a passion for building websites, writing automation tests, and working
          with fellow developers to produce clean code. 
          <br><br>
          <mark>Now that the formal stuff is in the way, let me tell you why you just clicked on one of the best portfolio sites you'll ever lay your eyes on.
          See that github link above? Yeah, that's not there for no reason. I've got an abundance of creative and fun personal projects and websites just
          dangling in there, waiting for someone to fork them. Oh, and this website? I built this baby with no 3rd party sources. That's right! no Squarespace, 
          no Wordpress, just me pumping out raw html, css, and Javascript with my own bare hands. And that's only the scratch of the surface of what my front-end
          skills are capable of.</mark>
          <br><br>
          But before we get into projects and work experiences, I should tell you a bit more about myself.
